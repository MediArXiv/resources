# Submission Guidelines for Authors

*Please note that these guidelines are subject to change.*

## GENERAL INFORMATION

* MediArXiv accepts scholarly work from across the fields of media, communication and film studies, broadly defined, that is plausibly categorized and for which authors are correctly identified, and which authors have the legal right to share. Accepted work includes, but is not limited to, papers, book chapters, and reviews, essays, critiques and comments on other work, systematic reviews, hypotheses, ‘negative’ results, and data and methods papers.Work on MediArXiv is either research or engages with research. Over time, we are committed to accepting scholarly works produced in a variety of non-traditional media formats.
* Many of our published submissions fall into two major types:
	* Preprints of articles, books, or book chapters in parallel to traditional publication.
	* Previously published articles, books, or book chapters that you wish to make Open Access.
* Please check the database for [Sherpa/ROMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) for publisher policies on pre/post-prints
* We encourage submissions across all domains of media, film, and communication studies, along with cognate fields like information science and science & technology studies.
 
## YOUR SUBMISSIONS

* All submissions will go through a basic screening process to check for conformation with these guidelines.
* Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will be removed, and the authors notified.
* Please make sure that all co-authors are aware of, and have agreed to, submission. They will be notified upon submission of preprints.
* Before submitting, it is recommended to add a note to the front page stating "This is a preprint that has been submitted to journal [INSERT Name]" where applicable. When updating to the postprint or accepted author manuscript, please change to "This is a postprint that has been peer reviewed and accepted at journal [INSERT NAME].” A template for this is available [here](https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Cover_Letter_Template.md).
* All preprints can be updated with the postprint version or author-accepted manuscript. Please check for journal compliance and embargo periods where needed.
 
## USING MEDIARXIV ARTICLES

* Please note that preprints are not formally peer reviewed. When re-using them, and especially when citing, this status should be clearly marked.
* Please exercise the same care and judgment you would use for any research output when it comes to the re-use of preprints.
* We strongly encourage community interaction through commenting and sharing of preprints.
