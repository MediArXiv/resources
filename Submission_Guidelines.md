	* Preprints of articles, books, or book chapters in parallel to traditional publication.
	* Previously published articles, books, or book chapters that you wish to make Open Access.
* Please check the [Sherpa/ROMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) database for publisher policies on pre/post-prints
* We encourage submissions across all domains of media, film, and communication studies, along with cognate fields like information science and science & technology studies.
* We accept submissions in a number of language, including English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Finnish, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish. Additional languages may be added depending on Steering Committee competency.
 
## How To Share a Work On MediArXiv

1. Before submitting, it is recommended to add a note to the front page stating "This is a preprint that has been submitted to journal [INSERT Name]" where applicable.
