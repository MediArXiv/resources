# Call for Steering Committee Members - MediArXiv

The initial Steering Committee is excited to announce the forthcoming launch of MediArXiv, the nonprofit, open archive for media, film & communication studies. The open-access "preprint" server will soon accept papers and multimodal submissions from scholars across our diverse fields. MediArXiv will join the growing movement started by the math/physics/computer science-oriented arXiv.org over 25 years ago, as one of the first full-fledged preprint servers conceived for humanities and social science scholars. 

MediArxiv will accept working papers, pre-prints, accepted manuscripts (post-prints), and published manuscripts. The service is open to articles, books, and book chapters, as well as other scholarly forms (like video essays and digital humanities projects). 

Our aim is to promote open scholarship across media, film and communication studies around the world. In addition to accepting and moderating submissions, we plan to advocate for policy changes at the major media, film, & communication studies professional societies around the world--to push for open-access friendly policies, in particular, for the journals that these associations sponsor. 

MediArXiv will launch in early 2019 on the Open Science Framework, which already hosts a number of other discipline-specific open archives:

We are writing to solicit applications for additional Steering Committee membership, with an interest in, but not limited to, early career scholars and those who work in the Global South. We anticipate adding five- to six- additional members, who will help to establish and guide MediArXiv together with the existing members. In addition to governance, Steering Committee members commit to contribute to light moderation of submissions on a rotating basis.

Applications will be accepted through Friday, January 23, and successful applicants will be informed by January 30.
