Dear [Insert Name],

On behalf of MediArXiv and the Center for Open Science, I’m writing regarding your paper, [Paper Name], published in [Journal Name].

I am requesting that you [share](https://mediarxiv.org/submit) a copy of your manuscript (often known as a preprint or postprint) online in [MediArXiv](https://mediarxiv.org), which is a non-profit, open source, community-led digital publishing platform for media, film and communication scholarship. Our mission is to help scholars from around the world find ways of making their work freely accessible to a wider audience, without the high costs often associated with traditional journals.

The policy of the publisher, [Publisher Name], encourages authors to share their research through self-archiving, also known as ‘Green’ Open Access. In this case, the policy indicates that you would be allowed to share the accepted peer reviewed version (aka postprint) online, should you wish, free of charge.

To be clear, since [Publisher Name] holds the copyright to your paper, you are legally unable to share the final version of your paper in public. However, previous versions are allowed to be shared freely, and in this case you are permitted to share the postprint/preprint. This would save readers [Article Cost] each, which [Publisher Name] currently charges to read the published version of your paper.

It is also possible to apply this method to any other research papers you have previously published, and you can also attach other files such as code, data, and full-resolution images too should you wish.

Since launching in February 2019, MediARXiv has helped researchers to make many [research papers and other works](https://mediarxiv.org/discover), that would otherwise remain behind paywalls and inaccessible to most, freely available at no cost to them. This saves readers on average $30-60 each per article, and research has shown that articles shared this way gain a [citation boost of around 30%](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/) due to their increased availability.

Many articles on MediArXiv have been downloaded many times already, and the simple [submission](https://mediarxiv.org/submit) and publication process only takes a few minutes.  

I would be happy to help answer any questions you might have about the service, and congratulations again on your publication.

Best,

[Name]
