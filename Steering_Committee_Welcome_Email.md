Dear MediArXiv Steering Committee members,

This email is your official welcome to the MediArXiv Steering Committee. Thank you for your excellent applications, and for agreeing to serve MediArXiv!

This email has some important information, but only three (optional) requests for a reply:

* Please let us know if there is a problem with your name, title and/or affiliation, on our companion website: https://mediarxiv.com
* Please let us know if there is a language, other than English, for which you would feel comfortable moderating submissions in
* Please send your Twitter handle, if you have an account 

We have added everyone’s name, title, university and website on our companion site:

https://mediarxiv.com

And on our Github repository:

https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/README.md

Please take a moment to look over the list of your fellow Steering Committee members, to familiarize yourself. Also, please let us know if you would like any of your details changed, by Tuesday, 12 March--at which point we will send the information to the Center for Open Science, our technology partner, for the Steering Committee list on the official MediArXiv page:

https://mediarxiv.org

MediArXiv is open for submissions after a soft launch in early February, but we will have more publicity for our official launch at the end of March. We will send along more info about that launch as the date gets closer.

As we mentioned in a previous email, the main tasks for the Steering Committee are (1) advocacy, (2) governance and (3) moderation. 

For (1) advocacy, the idea is that we will all promote MediArXiv and complementary open access policies. The official launch will be one such opportunity, and please consider following the @mediarxiv Twitter account in advance. 

In terms of (2) governance, the initial Steering Committee adopted a series of tentative policies that the full Steering Committee will have the chance, in the weeks ahead, to debate, modify, and formally adopt.

* Moderation Policy: https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Moderation_Policy.md
* Submission Guidelines: https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Submission_Guidelines.md
* Diversity Statment: https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Diversity_Statement.md
* Code of Conduct: https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md
* FAQs: https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/FAQs.md

You might take a few minutes to look these over. (They appear, too, on our companion website.) We will follow up in the weeks ahead about these, as well as an additional, as-yet undrafted Steering Committee Governance policy.

In terms of (3) moderation, our plan is to set up a rotation whereby everyone will moderate one day every three weeks, according to a Moderation Schedule, which will be maintained here:

https://mediarxiv.com/moderation/

In addition, as mentioned above, please let us know if there is a language, other than English, that you would be willing and capable to review submissions .

We will follow up next week with three times for (very brief) moderation training, over Zoom. Once you’ve gone through the training, you will be added to the Open Science Framework (OSF) system as a MediArXiv moderator. If you don’t yet have an OSF account, please create one here:

https://osf.io/register/

We will add you as a moderator based on the email address you submitted in your Steering Committee application (also used for this note), so please let us know if you register for OSF with a different email address.

Here again is our tentative Moderation Policy:

https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Moderation_Policy.md

And a draft Moderation Guide:

https://github.com/MediArXiv/resources/blob/master/Moderation_Guide.pdf

Thank you for reading through this long email. Here again are the three (optional) requests for reply:

* Please let us know if there is a problem with your name, title and/or affiliation, on our companion website: https://mediarxiv.com
* Please let us know if there is a language, other than English, for which you would feel comfortable moderating submissions in
* Please send your Twitter handle, if you have an account

We extend our warmest welcome to you all. Thank you for your commitment to MediArXiv and to open access in our fields!

Sincerely,

Jeff Pooley, Jeroen Sondervan, Catherine Grant, Jussi Parikka, and Leah Lievrouw

[initial Steering Committee]
