## ARTICLE VII - GENERAL PROVISIONS

#### B. Deposits

All funds of the Corporation shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the Corporation with such banks, bankers, trust companies or other depositories as the Board of Directors may select or as may be selected by any Officer or Officers, agent or agents of the Corporation to whom such power may be delegated from time to time by the Board of Directors.

## ARTICLE VIII - CONFLICT OF INTEREST

No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its Directors or Officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnerships, association, or organization in which one or more of its Directors or Officers are Directors or Officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for that reason, or solely because the Director or Officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or her or their votes are counted for such purposes, if the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith, taking into account the fairness of contract or transaction, authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested Directors present.

## ARTICLE IX - INDEMNIFICATION

#### A. Mandatory Indemnification

The Corporation shall indemnify any Director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which the Director was a party because he or she is or was a Director of the Corporation against reasonable expenses actually incurred by the Director in connection with the proceeding.

#### B. Permissive Indemnification

The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit, or process if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable, cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability and in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses which the court shall deem proper. To the extent that a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding.

Any indemnification under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, Officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this section. The determination shall be made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding, or if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.

Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, Officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this section. The indemnification provided by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under the Statures of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other provision of law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws or any agreement, vote of disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The Corporation shall have the power to give any further indemnity, in addition to the indemnity authorized or contemplated under other subsections of this section, including subsection (6), to any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent, or to any person who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of any other Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, provided such further indemnity is either (i) authorized, directed, or provided for in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or any duly adopted amendment thereof or (ii) is authorized, directed, or provided for in these Bylaw or agreement of the Corporation which has been adopted by a vote of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, and provided further that no such indemnity shall indemnify any person from or on account of such person’s conduct which was finally adjudged to have been knowingly fraudulent, deliberately dishonest or willful misconduct.
For the purpose of this section, references to the “the Corporation” include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation so that any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would if he or she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.

For purposes of this section, the term “other enterprise” shall include employee benefit plans; the term “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and the term “serving at the request of the Corporation” shall include any service as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such Director, Officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation” as referred to in this section. 

#### C. Insurance

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or who, while a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic business or nonprofit Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against liability asserted against or incurred by him or her in that capacity or arising from his or her status as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify the person against the same liability under section (A) or (B) above.

## ARTICLE X - FISCAL YEAR

The fiscal year of the organization shall commence on January 1 and terminate on December 31.

## ARTICLE XI - AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES AND BYLAWS
