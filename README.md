# PaleorXiv

PaleorXiv is a free community-led digital archive for Paleontology research. We provide a non-profit platform for paleontologists to upload their working papers, pre-prints, accepted manuscripts (post-prints), and published papers. We also provide options to link data and code, and for article versioning. PaleorXiv is dedicated to speeding and opening up paleontological research and helping to build the future of scholarly communication.

We launched in the summer of 2017, and are open for submissions.
