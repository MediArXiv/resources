# MediArXiv

MediArXiv is a free, community-led digital archive for media, film, and communication research (hosted on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/preprints/)). We provide a non-profit platform for media, film, and communication scholars to upload their working papers, pre-prints, accepted manuscripts (post-prints), and published manuscripts. The service is open for articles, books, and book chapters.

The mission of MediArXiv is to open up media, film, and communication research to a broader readership and to help build the future of scholarly communication.

We launched in the winter of 2019, and are now open for submissions.
