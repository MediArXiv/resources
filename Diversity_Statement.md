# MediArXiv Diversity Statement

Capturing a broad spectrum of interest and experiences will help MediArXiv consider and include the full media, communicator, and film studies community. An essential step to achieving this objective is to ensure its Steering Committeeâ€™s diversity.

Media research is conducted by people of a diverse range of demographics and psychographics, including gender identities, sexual orientations, racial and cultural backgrounds, abilities, religions, ages, career stages and fields, and socioeconomic and immigration statuses. These identities impact on how scholarship is produced and shared. We recognize that a diverse and inclusive scholarly community asks a broader range of questions, yet also faces different barriers to participating in media studies. By listening to diverse voices, we will be rewarded by a greater understanding of our world.

Scholars of media hail from a diverse range of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary backgrounds that span the humanities and social sciences. MediArXiv is committed to representing that intellectual diversity in its Steering Committee membership.

In an effort to represent and include the broadest possible spectrum of media scholars, MediArXiv is committed to the following objectives in forming its Steering Committee:

* **FIELD:** We will aim to include representatives from a broad spectrum of media studies fields such as film studies, speech and rhetoric, communication, information studies, media studies, and science & technology studies. 
* **GENDER IDENTITY:** We will strive for gender parity in our Steering Committee, with awareness of the need for flexibility to include transgender and gender-fluid people.
* **ETHNIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND:** We will strive to include a broad range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds in our Steering Committee, with particular focus on traditionally excluded populations including Asian, black, indigenous, Pacific island, and Latin scholars.
* **GEOGRAPHY:** We will respect the global nature of the media studies community by aiming for significant representation from regions beyond North America and Europe.
* **CAREER:** We will aim to have at least one representative each from key stages within academia including students; early-, mid-, and late-career professors; researchers at teaching-centric and research-centric universities; and independent scholars.
* **ABILITY:** We will aim to include representatives with a broad range of physical and mental abilities.
* **SEXUAL ORIENTATION:** We will aim to include representatives with a broad range of sexual orientations.

We recognize that we may not always achieve all of these objectives, and will be as transparent as possible about our effectiveness within the confines of respecting the privacy of our Steering Committee members.

We also recognize we may not yet be considering all aspects of how identity shapes the science that we do. We further commit to continuing to learn and adapt how we define and include diverse populations in response to the needs of our greater community.
